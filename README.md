## Replit 100 Days of Code

This repository documents my completion of Replit’s 100 Days of Code challenge.
The aim was to build consistency, strengthen core programming concepts,
and progressively tackle more complex problems.

The days folder contains all the main code of each day. The projects folder contains code of projects I developed whilst completing the course by building on my knowledge either from scratch or building on from code from another day.
